# Project data

## Logical structure

Bryntum Gantt operates on a top-level entity called a "Project". A Project consists of several collections
of other entities. Collections are created as instances of the [Store](#Core/data/Store) class in the Bryntum Core
package and individual entities are represented by [Model](#Core/data/Model) instances.

Bryntum Gantt manages the project's data using the [Scheduling Engine](engine). The engine is a separate project written
in TypeScript. Gantt makes use of the mixins defined in the Scheduling Engine to build the actual classes that are used
to store and manage the data. If you are new to the mixin concept, you can check
this [blog post](https://bryntum.com/blog/the-mixin-pattern-in-typescript-all-you-need-to-know/)
to become familiar with it. The main idea is that you can freely combine several mixins and not be tied to a single
superclass in the hierarchy (as you would be if using classic single superclass inheritance).

The "Project" itself is represented by a [ProjectModel](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel). It is a
regular [Model](#Core/data/Model), capable of storing any project-wide configuration options.

The primary collections of the Project are:

* [Calendar manager store](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-calendarManagerStore). This is a tree store containing all
  the calendars of the Project. The collection is represented by
  a [CalendarManagerStore](#Gantt/data/CalendarManagerStore). The entity is represented by
  a [CalendarModel](#Gantt/model/CalendarModel). Please refer to the
  [calendars guide](#Gantt/guides/basics/calendars.md) for more information about the calendars system in Bryntum Gantt.

* [Resources store](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-resourceStore). This is a flat store, keeping all resources of
  the Project. The collection is represented by a [ResourceStore](#Gantt/data/ResourceStore). The entity is represented
  by a [ResourceModel](#Gantt/model/ResourceModel).

* [Task store](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-taskStore). This is a flat store, keeping all tasks of the Project.
  The collection is represented by a [TaskStore](#Gantt/data/TaskStore). The entity is represented by
  a [TaskModel](#Gantt/model/TaskModel).

* [Assignment store](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-assignmentStore). This is a flat store, keeping all assignments
  of the Project. The collection is represented by a [AssignmentStore](#Gantt/data/AssignmentStore). The entity is
  represented by a [AssignmentModel](#Gantt/model/AssignmentModel).

* [Dependency store](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-dependencyStore). This is a flat store, keeping all dependencies
  of the Project. The collection is represented by a [DependencyStore](#Gantt/data/DependencyStore). The entity is
  represented by a [DependencyModel](#Gantt/model/DependencyModel).

Please refer to the documentation of mentioned classes above for detailed lists of available fields and methods.

## Creating a project

A project can be created as any other regular [Model](#Core/data/Model) instance. For example, here we create a project
with a specified start date and initial data for the internal stores (example assumes using the UMD bundle):

```javascript
const project = new bryntum.gantt.ProjectModel({
    startDate  : '2017-01-01',

    tasksData : [
        { id : 1, name : 'Proof-read docs', startDate : '2017-01-02', endDate : '2017-01-09' },
        { id : 2, name : 'Release docs', startDate : '2017-01-09', endDate : '2017-01-10' }
    ],

    dependenciesData : [
        { fromTask : 1, toTask : 2 }
    ]
});
```

All project stores are created from scratch, but they will remain empty if no data was provided to them.

## Working with inline data

The project provides an [inlineData](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-inlineData) getter/setter that can
be used to manage data from all Project stores at once. Populating the stores this way can
be useful if you do not want to use the CrudManager for server communication but instead load data using Axios
or similar.

### Getting data
```javascript
const data = gantt.project.inlineData;

/*
Structure of inlineData:

data = {
    resourcesData : [/*...*/],
    eventsData : [/*...*/],
    dependenciesData : [/*...*/],
    assignmentsData : [/*...*/]
}
/*

// use the data in your application
```

### Setting data
```javascript
// Get data from server manually
const data = await axios.get('/project?id=12345');

// Feed it to the project
gantt.project.inlineData = data;
```

See also [loadInlineData](#Scheduler/model/mixin/ProjectModelMixin#function-loadInlineData)

### Getting changed records

You can access the changes in the current Project dataset anytime using
the [changes](#Scheduler/model/mixin/ProjectModelMixin#property-changes) property. It returns an object with all
changes:

```
const changes = project.changes;

console.log(changes);

> {
tasks : {
    updated : [{
        name : 'My task',
        id   : 12
    }]
},
assignments : {
    added : [{
        event      : 12,
        resource   : 7,
        units      : 100,
        $PhantomId : 'abc123'
    }]
    }
};
```

## Adding custom fields to entities

You can add any number of custom fields to any entity of the project (including project itself). For that, first,
subclass that entity and list additional fields in the accessor for
static [fields](#Core/data/Model#property-fields-static) property. For example, to add `company` field to
the [ResourceModel](#Gantt/model/ResourceModel):

```javascript
class MyResourceModel extends ResourceModel {
    static get fields() {
        return [
            { field: 'company', type: 'string' }
        ]
    }
}
```

When creating the project, specify the newly defined model class using
the [resourceModelClass](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#config-resourceModelClass) config. There are analogous configs for
the other entities managed by the project.

See the API docs for [Model](#Core/data/Model) for more information on defining and mapping fields.

If you want to use a custom store type for some collection, do it in the same way - first subclass the store class, then
use [resourceStoreClass](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#config-resourceStoreClass) config or similar during project creation.

## Updating the project data

The [Model](#Core/data/Model) class lets you define special kind of properties of the class, which are called "fields".
Defining a field will auto-create accessors to get/set its value, so the usage looks very much like a regular property:

```javascript
class MyModel extends Model {
    static get fields() {
        return [
            { name : 'myField', type : 'string' }
        ]
    }
}

const myModel = new MyModel({ myField : 'someValue' })

// read
const lowerCased = myModel.someValue.toLowerCase()
// write
myModel.someValue = 'anothervalue'
```

## Changes propagation

One important thing to know is that some fields in the Gantt entities are special. These are the fields that, when
changed, will cause changes of other fields including other dependent entity fields (potentially many others). This
process is called - __propagation of changes__, or just
__propagation__. For example, a change of the start date of a task, will be propagated and potentially will cause
changes in many other dependent tasks.

For fields that cause this propagation of changes, one should normally use *setter methods* instead of using direct
accessors. The setter method is a regular method whose name starts with `set` and then continues with the uppercased
field name. For example, for the
[startDate](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-startDate) field, the setter method will
be: [setStartDate](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#function-setStartDate).

**The setter methods that affect the schedule are asynchronous and return a `Promise`**. It's done this way since during
calculation of the new schedule, a scheduling conflict may arise, requiring user input on how to resolve it. This brings
an asynchronous "gap" into the calculation. Thankfully, because `async/await` syntax is supported by every modern
browser now, the changes for the code are minimal.

**It is forbidden to modify the schedule, while an asynchronous change propagation is in progress.**. One should always
use `then` method of the returned `Promise`, or `await` the method call.

For example, let's say we want to change the start date of a task which may affect many other tasks in the schedule.
Using a plain `Promise`, it would look like:

```javascript
const eventStore    = project.eventStore
const event         = eventStore.getById(1)

event.setStartDate(new Date(2019, 3, 25)).then(() => {
    ... // continue after start date update
})
```

Or, with `async/await` (wrapped with extra function, since global `async/await` is still in the proposal stage):

```javascript
const updateStartDate = async () => {
    const eventStore    = project.eventStore
    const event         = eventStore.getById(1)

    await event.setStartDate(new Date(2019, 3, 25))

    ... // continue after start date update
}
```

Such asynchronous setters methods are explicitly marked as returning `Promise` in the documentation.

In general, in most cases you should use API methods, like [assign](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#function-assign)
/[unassign](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#function-unassign)
instead of manually modifying the store ([AssignmentStore](#Gantt/data/AssignmentStore) in this case).

## Triggering propagation manually

Sometimes you might need to initiate propagation of changes manually. This is needed if you have directly added/removed
an entity from the collection, bypassing an API method that returns a `Promise` or if you used accessors to modify some
entity. For example:

```javascript
const eventStore    = project.eventStore
const event         = eventStore.add({ name : 'New task', startDate : new Date(2019, 3, 1), duration : 1 })

// now let's trigger propagation to perform automatic scheduling
project.commitAsync().then(() => {
    ... // continue after adding a new task
})
```

## Updating data on task change

Sometimes it happens that you need to update a task based on changes done to another task. For that you can subscribe
to [change](#Gantt/data/TaskStore#event-change) event, check if the action is correct, check that data has been changed.
Also need to check that [State Tracking Manager](#Core/data/stm/StateTrackingManager)
is not [restoring](#Core/data/stm/StateTrackingManager#property-isRestoring) data, otherwise restoring will trigger
recalculation again.

For example, you need to set all predecessors to 100% done when the task gets 100%, or reset them to 0% otherwise:

```javascript
project.taskStore.on({
    change : ({ action, record, changes }) => {
        // if some task has updated its percentDone field ..and this is not State Tracking Manager rollback
        if (action === 'update' && changes?.percentDone && !record.project.stm.isRestoring) {
            // change the task predecessors percentDone
            record.predecessorTasks.forEach(task => task.percentDone = changes.percentDone.value === 100 ? 100 : 0);
        }
    }
});
```

## Persisting the project data

The [ProjectModel](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel) class implements
a [AbstractCrudManagerMixin](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin) mixin, specialized for Gantt. It uses
the [JsonEncoder](#Scheduler/crud/encoder/JsonEncoder) for serialization
and [AjaxTransport](#Scheduler/crud/transport/AjaxTransport) for communication with server.

The crud manager mixin, provides two additional methods for the project instance:

- [load](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-load) Loads a new data package from server. The data package
  will contain data for all stores, used in the project.
- [sync](#Scheduler/crud/AbstractCrudManagerMixin#function-sync) Persists the changes from all project stores to the
  server.

For more general information about the Crud manager architecture please refer
to [this guide](#Gantt/guides/data/crud_manager.md).

If you want to manage saving yourself not involving the communication API provided by the Project, you can access the
current changes in the Project anytime using the [changes](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#property-changes)
property.

```javascript
const taskStore    = project.taskStore
taskStore.getById(1).name = 'New name'

console.log(project.changes);

// outputs:
// {
//      tasks : {
//          modified : [
//              { id : 1, name : 'New name' }
//          ]
//     }
// }
```

## Monitoring data changes

While it is possible to listen for data changes on the projects individual stores, it is sometimes more convenient
to have a centralized place to handle all data changes. By listening for the 
[change event](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#event-change) your code gets notified when data in any of the stores changes. 
Useful for example to keep an external data model up to date:

```javascript
const gantt = new Gantt({
    project: {
        listeners : {
            change({ store, action, records }) {
                const { $name } = store.constructor;

                if (action === 'add') {
                    externalDataModel.add($name, records);
                }

                if (action === 'remove') {
                    externalDataModel.remove($name, records);
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```
  
## Duration units conversion

Duration conversion happens when we change [duration unit](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-durationUnit) of a task or
use [duration](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-duration) to calculate the
task [start](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-startDate) or [end date](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-endDate). The Gantt
chart then needs to calculate for example, the duration of a one day task in hours.

There are special properties defined on the [project](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel) which specify ratios to convert units:

* [hoursPerDay](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#field-hoursPerDay) - number of `hours` in a `day` (default value is 24).
* [daysPerWeek](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#field-daysPerWeek) - number of `days` in a `week` (default value is 7).
* [daysPerMonth](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#field-daysPerMonth) - number of `days` in a `month` (default value is 30).
