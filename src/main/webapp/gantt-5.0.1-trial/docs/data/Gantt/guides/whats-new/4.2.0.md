# What's new in Gantt v4.2.0

## Infinite time axis scroll

This release adds a long awaited feature for Gantt - infinite scroll along the time axis. To enable it, configure your
gantt with `infiniteScroll : true`. When a user scrolls to near the start or end of the  time axis, it will be 
seamlessly extended. Try it out in the new [infinite-scroll demo](../examples/infinite-scroll) or right here:

<div class="external-example" data-file="Gantt/guides/whats-new/4.2.0/infinitescroll.js"></div>

## Easier to create dependencies using drag and drop

Dependencies can now be created by dropping anywhere on the task bar element, whereas in previous versions you had to
hit a specific side circle element to define it. This new behaviour is controlled using the
[allowDropOnEventBar](#Scheduler/feature/mixin/DependencyCreation#config-allowDropOnEventBar) config of the Dependencies
feature. It is enabled by default, try it here:

<div class="external-example" data-file="Gantt/guides/whats-new/4.2.0/dependencies.js"></div>
