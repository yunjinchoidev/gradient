# What's new in Gantt v4.2.7

## Disabling scheduling engine calculations

Added new [setCalculations](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#function-setCalculations) method to the
[ProjectModel](#Gantt/model/ProjectModel#function-setCalculations) class. The method toggles the project
owned model fields calculation functions. That allows changing the standard fields behavior dynamically.
Please check new `static` demo for details.
