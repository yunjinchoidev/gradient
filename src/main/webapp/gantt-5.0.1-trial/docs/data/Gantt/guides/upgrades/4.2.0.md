# Upgrade guide for Gantt v4.2.0

## TaskDragCreate

The `TaskDragCreate` feature now operates on a live instance of a `TaskModel`, updating its dates as you drag as opposed
to the previous behaviour which updated then when the operation ended.

## Dependencies can now be created by dropping anywhere on the task bar element

In previous versions you had to hit a specific side circle element to define it. The new behavior allows you to 
setup a dependency by dropping anywhere on the task bar. This creates a dependency with the default type, as 
defined by the `defaultValue` of the DependencyModel `type` field.

If you prefer the old behavior, simply set `allowDropOnEventBar` to false on the feature config:

```javascript
const gantt = new Gantt({
    features : {
        dependencies : {
            allowDropOnEventBar : false
        }
    }
});
```
