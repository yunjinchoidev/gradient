# What's new in Gantt v4.2.4

## Configurable behavior in DST time zones

Prior to this release, Project would try to keep duration in days an integer number if task start and end dates were
midnight. Meaning duration in hours is always an integer multiple of 24. However, if odd number of DST transitions occur
between start and end that rule does not apply.

In this release we're changing the default behavior. Now Project will not try to add or remove an extra hour from duration,
if DST transition occur. If you want to keep the old behavior, please set this config on the project:

```javascript
new Gantt({
  project : {
    adjustDurationToDST : true
  }
})
```
