# What's new in Gantt v4.3.0

## Inactive tasks support

This version brings support for **inactive tasks**, tasks that do not affect scheduling of normal tasks. They do not 
push their **active** successors (but still pushes **inactive ones**) and do not roll up their 
([startDate](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-startDate),
[endDate](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-endDate), [percentDone](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-percentDone) and
[effort](#Gantt/model/TaskModel#field-effort)) attributes to their **active parents** (but still do that for 
**inactive ones**).

Activating or deactivating a summary task also toggles the state of all its children. Activating a child task in turn 
activates its summary tasks and deactivating **all child tasks** also deactivates
their summary task.

Inactive tasks do not affect resource allocation and are thus not taken into account by the 
[resource histogram](#SchedulerPro/view/ResourceHistogram).

For more details please see the ["Inactive tasks" guide](#Gantt/guides/basics/inactive_tasks.md).

## Support for resources grouping in the histogram

[The histogram](#SchedulerPro/view/ResourceHistogram) now supports resource grouping. It collects resources info and 
displays the aggregated allocation on the group level:

**Please note** that [GroupSummary](#Grid/feature/GroupSummary) feature is still not supported
(subscribe to [this ticket](https://github.com/bryntum/support/issues/2283) to stay informed).
