# What's new in Scheduler Pro v4.2.4

## Creation of new events is now prevented on non working time blocks

Scheduler Pro now better respects your non-working time ranges, meaning no event will be created:

1. ...when you double click to create events
2. ...when you initiate drag create
3. ...when you right click to show the schedule menu

on a non working time block (as defined by the resource calendar or project calendar).
