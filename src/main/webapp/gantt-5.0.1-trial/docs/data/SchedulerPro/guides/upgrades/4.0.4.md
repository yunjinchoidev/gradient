## Deprecated showDeleteButton on TaskEdit feature

The `showDeleteButton` config on the TaskEdit feature was deprecated in favor of the `items` config. It will be removed
in 5.0. If you use it, the following snippets shows how to update your code:

**Old code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    features : {
        taskEdit : {
            showDeleteButton : false
        }
    }
});
```

**New code**

```javascript
const scheduler = new SchedulerPro({
    features : {
        taskEdit : {
            editorConfig : {
                bbar : {
                    items : {
                        deleteButton : false
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```
