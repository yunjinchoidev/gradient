# What's new in Scheduler Pro v4.1.5

## `beforeTaskEditShow` listeners can now be used to change/apply initial values

This release has changes to the `beforeTaskEditShow` event that might affect the logic of your app:
1. It is now possible to assign values to task editor fields using a `beforeTaskEditShow` listener.
2. Values that are programmatically applied to the fields using `beforeTaskEditShow` and later will now be applied to the task record (previously only user-typed changes were applied).
3. If a field is added to a task editor in a `beforeTaskEditShow` listener, make sure to apply an initial value for it since default values are applied at an earlier stage.
