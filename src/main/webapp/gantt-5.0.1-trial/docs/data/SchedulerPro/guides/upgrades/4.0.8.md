# What's new in Scheduler Pro v4.0.8

## Added short responses support to Crud Manager

Crud Manager default behaviour has been changed to allow short `sync` responses that include only server-side changes.
Previously it was mandatory to mention all updated and removed records in the response to confirm the changes are
applied. With this release the Crud Manager automatically confirms changes of all updated/removed records mentioned in
the corresponding `sync` request. If your code relies on the old behavior please
use [supportShortSyncResponse](#SchedulerPro/model/ProjectModel#config-supportShortSyncResponse)
to enable it back. To revert to the old behavior please set
[supportShortSyncResponse](#SchedulerPro/model/ProjectModel#config-supportShortSyncResponse) config to `false`:

```javascript
new SchedulerPro({
    /*...*/
    project : {
        // disable simlified responses support
        supportShortSyncResponse : false,
        /*...*/
    }
});
```
