## CSS encoding

Bryntum now uses [Dart SASS](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) to compile CSS from SCSS for the themes. It outputs CSS
encoded with UTF-8. The encoding is specified at the top of the CSS file as a `@charset` tag:

```css
@charset "UTF-8";
```

It is important that this tag is preserved in the CSS used on page, to guarantee that font icons render as intended.

Minified CSS instead uses a byte order mark to specify encoding, which although invisible to the eye should be preserved
in the file used on page.

If you use a custom build process that includes our CSS and icons are not rendered correctly in all browsers, the issue
is most likely caused by missing encoding info. Try adding it back or serving the CSS with correct encoding specified in
the HTTP header.

## DependencyCreation events

DependencyCreation events were all missing useful params about the state of the creation state as you drag and drop to
setup a link between two events. The `data` param is now deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.

**Old code:**

```javascript
scheduler.on({
    beforedependencycreatedrag({ data }) {
        // Use undocumented params in data
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
scheduler.on({
    dependencycreatedrop({ source, target, dependency }) {
        // Documented access to source task, target task, and the created dependency
    }
});
```
