# Gantt ASP.NET Core demo

This demo shows Gantt component working with backend on ASP.NET Core with MySQL as a database.

## Bryntum Repository access setup

**IMPORTANT NOTE!** These access instructions are mandatory when using the private Bryntum NPM repository.

This example uses npm packages from the Bryntum private NPM repository. You must be logged-in to this repository as a
licensed or trial user to access the packages. Please
check [Online npm repository guide](https://bryntum.com/docs/gantt/guide/Gantt/npm-repository) for detailed information
on the sign-up/login process. Also you can check bundled guide inside distribution zip
in `docs/guides/npm-repository.md`.

## Setup

There are few ways to start the application:

1. [Manual installation](#manual-installation)
2. [Using Docker](#using-docker) (recommended)
3. [Use Docker for MySQL and platform-native .NET Core](#Docker-+-platform-native-.NET)

## Manual installation

### Prerequisites

1. MySQL server
2. .NET Core 3.1
3. ASP.NET Core 3.1
4. NodeJS 10+

### Setup MySQL server

1. Create new database called `bryntum_gantt`

    ```
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `bryntum_gantt`;
    ```

2. Create new user

    ```
    CREATE USER 'USERNAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
    GRANT ALL ON `bryntum_gantt`.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%';
    ```

3. Setup tables with initial data

    ```
    aspnetcore$ mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD bryntum_gantt < ./sql/setup.sql
    ```

If setup was successful you should see this output from mysql

```
# mysql -ubryntum -pbryntum bryntum_gantt
mysql> show tables;

8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Build JS application

```
aspnetcore$ (cd BryntumGanttDemo/wwwroot/app && npm i && npm run build)
```

### Building .NET application

Use IDE (Visual Studio 2019, VS Code + extensions, etc) to open solution. Alternatively, you can use CLI:

1. Install NuGet packages
    ```
    aspnetcore$ cd BryntumGanttDemo
    BryntumGanttDemo$ dotnet restore
    ```
2. Change MySQL connection settings at `BryntumGanttDemo/appsettings.json`

3. Run app
    ```
    BryntumGanttDemo$ dotnet run
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Hosting environment: Development
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Content root path: ...Gantt\examples\aspnetcore\BryntumGanttDemo
    ```

Now you can open application at http://localhost:5000

## Using Docker

### Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. NodeJS 10+

### Install Docker

Refer to the docker docs to learn how to install Docker:
https://docs.docker.com/install/

If you are using Linux, make sure to follow post-installation steps described in this guide:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

### Configure

There is a `docker-compose.yml` config in the application root folder which specifies environment required to run the
application. Environment is just two containers:

1. [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) version 8.0.

    Container will have MySQL database with a required tables created, running on default port, exposed to localhost:33062.

2. [ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-aspnet/) version 3.1.

    Container will build and run ASP.NET Core application, exposed to localhost:8080.

### Start

Before starting docker-compose we have to set up the credentials to access Bryntum's private NPM repo. Ð¡heck the [Online npm repository guide](https://bryntum.com/docs/gantt/guide/Gantt/npm-repository) for detailed information.

Copy the `.npmrc` file into the root dir of this example. That file should contain credentials to access the Bryntum npm repo.
Example of `.nmprc` content:
```
@bryntum:registry=https://npm.bryntum.com
//npm.bryntum.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

Fill in with your token `Dockerfile` (`ARG` property) and `docker-compose.yml` (`NPM_TOKEN` property).

To start application with docker it is enough to call:

    aspnetcore$ docker-compose up

Now wait until mysql container is up and listening to connection, you will see this message in console

```
/usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections. Version: '8.0.19'
  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server - GPL.
  ```

meaning app is ready to use. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and see.

## Docker + platform-native .NET

This is convenient way to develop application in IDE without having to install and setup MySQL database.

### Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. NodeJS 10+
3. .NET Core 3.1
4. ASP.NET Core 3.1

### Setup

1. Start MySQL container

   Run this to only start MySQL container

        docker-compose up -d db

   MySQL will be listening on `localhost:33062`

2. Build JS/.NET Application

   Build JS and .NET applications as described in the [Manual installation](#dotner) section
